# Supply Chain Analytics Project

## **Overview**
This project focuses on supply chain analytics for a Fashion and Beauty startup specializing in makeup products. The goal is to analyze the supply chain data to optimize performance, reduce costs, and enhance customer satisfaction.

---

## **Dataset**
The dataset contains information about the supply chain of makeup products, with the following features:

- **Product Details**: Product Type, SKU, Price, Availability
- **Sales and Revenue**: Number of products sold, Revenue generated
- **Stock and Inventory**: Stock levels, Order quantities, Lead times
- **Shipping Details**: Shipping times, Shipping carriers, Shipping costs
- **Supplier Information**: Supplier name, Location, Lead time, Defect rates
- **Production Details**: Manufacturing lead time, Production volumes, Manufacturing costs
- **Inspection Results**: Quality control outcomes
- **Transportation**: Modes, Routes, Costs

---

## **Objectives**
1. Understand the dataset and clean it for analysis.
2. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and insights.
3. Visualize the data for better understanding and actionable insights.
4. Provide recommendations to optimize supply chain performance.

## **Analysis and Insights**
### **Exploratory Data Analysis**
- Checked for duplicates and missing values.
- Explored correlations between numerical variables.

### **Visualizations**
1. **Distribution of Product Types**: Identifies product focus areas.
2. **Price Distribution**: Assesses pricing strategies and outliers.
3. **Revenue vs. Number of Products Sold**: Analyzes the relationship between sales volume and revenue.
4. **Average Shipping Costs by Carrier**: Highlights cost-effective carriers.
5. **Defect Rates by Supplier**: Identifies suppliers impacting quality.
6. **Lead Times vs. Order Quantities**: Explores bulk ordering patterns.
7. **Stock Levels by Product Type**: Guides inventory optimization.
8. **Transportation Mode Preferences**: Reveals transportation trends.
9. **Costs Distribution**: Points to cost optimization opportunities.
10. **Inspection Results Distribution**: Highlights quality control performance.

### **Insights**
- High-defect-rate suppliers require performance reviews.
- Significant cost variations among shipping carriers.
- Premium products contribute to revenue despite lower sales volumes.
- Overstocked products indicate potential inefficiencies in inventory management.
